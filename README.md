# Tinda CSS
Juntoz CSS library for ECommerce websites

// Status from github

# note about npm scope
This package is published to jztechpe-pub which is our public scoped registry in npm.

We had to do this like this because we have our own github packages private registry so it was not possible to combine them both during our development.

# Quick install
```sh
npm install @jztechpe-pub/tinda
```

**or**

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @jztechpe-pub/tinda
```
